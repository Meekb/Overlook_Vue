# Overlook Hotel - Currently Under Construction ðŸ¦ºðŸ› 

## Overview
This is a rebuild of an earlier vanilla JS project called Overlook. It's a hotel booking application which allows a user to login with a username and password, view the total amount of money spent at the hotel, view details of their previous stays, and book future stays. The project is under construction using Vue 3 with Nuxt.js so **PLEASE PARDON THE MESS**. End to end testing will be completed using Cypress.

*[The original spec for Overlook can be found here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/overlook.html)*

## Walkthrough of Overlook at current stage of development

Providing an incorrect username or password will throw an error for the user then clear the input fields for re-entry

Once successfully logged in, the user can view their history with Overlook Hotel including the total dollars they've spent. 
Wow, that's a lot of money! This hotel must be REALLY popular

User searches by providing a check-in date and selecting a room type

If no rooms of that type are available for the check-in date, the user will receive a strongly worded message advising them to 
change the room type or adjust their check-in date

Once a room has been booked, the user will receive a success message and confirmation number for their records
